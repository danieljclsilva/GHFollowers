# iOS Dev Interview Prep - Take Home Project

This repository contains the code for the "iOS Dev Interview Prep - Take Home Project - UIKit - Programmatic UI" course by Sean Allen. This project is designed to help you practice for iOS developer job interviews by walking you through a typical take-home assignment.

## Project Overview

In this project, we build a complete iOS app that fetches a list of followers from a GitHub username via a network call and allows the user to set and persist a favorite GitHub user. The app is built using 100% programmatic UI without any third-party libraries, and is compatible with iOS 15, 16, and 17.

## Features

- Programmatic UI using UIKit
- Network calls to fetch data from GitHub API
- Persist favorite GitHub users
- Updated for iOS 15, 16, & iOS 17

## Learning Outcomes

- Understanding of programmatic UI development in UIKit
- Experience with making network calls and handling JSON data
- Techniques for persisting data locally
- Preparation for common take-home projects in iOS dev job interviews
